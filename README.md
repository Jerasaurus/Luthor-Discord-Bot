[![Discord Bot CD](https://github.com/TomAndJerry342/Discord/actions/workflows/buildAndDeploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TomAndJerry342/Discord/actions/workflows/buildAndDeploy.yml)


This is a cool discord bot im attempting to write with at least good practices in orginzation and mostly as a side project to learn TS.
Slash command support + text commands + dyanmic help command = cool.
 
 No support provided for selfhosting. Mostly if people want to check out the inner workings of the bot.
